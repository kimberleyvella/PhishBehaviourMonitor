# PhishBehaviourMonitor

This repository contains the following files:

1. `demo_application`: An HTML page demonstrating different colored divs and event listeners. This can be used to understand the behaviour monitoring functionality.

2. `phish_behaviour_monitor`: A modified version of an Angular web page with integrated behaviour monitoring. This modified version includes additional functionality to track user interactions and monitor phishing behaviour.

3. `result_program`: A Python program to process the CSV results obtained from the behaviour monitoring. This program can be used to analyse and extract valuable insights from the collected data.

## Usage

1. Open `demo_application.html` in a web browser to see the demonstration of different colored divs and event listeners. Interact with the divs to observe the behaviour monitoring.

2. Clone the `phish_behaviour_monitor` directory to your local development environment. Follow the instructions in the README file within that directory to integrate the behaviour monitoring into your Angular web page.

3. Use `csv_reader.py` to process the CSV results generated by the behaviour monitoring. This program provides analysis and insights based on the collected data.
